# MarkMoki — Full‑Stack Engineer | Cloud & DevOps | Data/AI

Building performant, secure, and scalable software. I design pragmatic architectures, ship production‑grade features end‑to‑end, and automate everything from CI/CD to observability.

---

## Core Competencies
- Frontend engineering: Design systems, accessible UI, high‑FPS interactions, SSR/SSG, micro‑frontends
- Backend engineering: API design, microservices, event‑driven systems, performance tuning, caching strategies
- Cloud & DevOps: IaC, CI/CD, containers, orchestration, monitoring, cost optimization, SRE practices
- Data & AI: Feature engineering, model serving, analytics pipelines, data visualization
- Product delivery: Roadmapping, stakeholder alignment, iterative delivery, measurable outcomes

## Impact Highlights
- Improved page performance (Largest Contentful Paint) by 45% via code‑splitting, image pipelines, and critical CSS
- Reduced cloud costs by 30% through right‑sizing, autoscaling policies, spot usage, and storage lifecycle rules
- Cut deploy lead time from hours to minutes with GitOps, preview environments, and automated quality gates
- Increased API throughput 5× by introducing async workers, read replicas, and a layered caching strategy
- Boosted conversion by 12% through A/B tested UX changes, form latency reduction, and telemetry‑driven iterations

## Tech Stack (by depth)

- Languages: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin, PHP, Java, SQL, Bash
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, TailwindCSS, React Native, Three.js
- Backend: Node.js (Express/Fastify/Nest), Django/DRF, Flask, Laravel; GraphQL/REST/WebSockets
- Datastores: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, Kafka (pub/sub), Supabase
- Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP; Vercel, Netlify, Firebase; Cloudflare (Workers/Pages)
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Nginx
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Grafana, ELK, Sentry
- Data/AI: TensorFlow, scikit‑learn, Pandas, Matplotlib; batch/stream pipelines
- Tooling: Vite, Esbuild, Babel, PNPM/Yarn/NPM, Postman, Figma, Power BI

---

## Architecture & Practices
- Patterns: Hexagonal/Clean Architecture, CQRS, event sourcing, circuit‑breaker, saga
- APIs: Contract‑first (OpenAPI/GraphQL SDL), pagination/filters, idempotency, rate limiting
- Security: JWT/OAuth2, mTLS, OWASP ASVS, secret management, workload identity
- Performance: Profiling, tracing, caching layers (CDN, edge, app, DB), background jobs
- Data: Schema design, migrations, indexing, VACUUM/ANALYZE routines, partitioning
- Quality: TDD where it pays, integration/e2e tests, static analysis, type safety, linting/formatting

---

## Selected Work Snapshots
- Real‑time analytics dashboard: WebSockets + Kafka + React; sub‑200ms p95 update latency
- E‑commerce platform revamp: Next.js + Edge rendering; 45% LCP improvement and 12% conversion lift
- ML feature service: Python + FastAPI + TensorFlow Serving; A/B tested uplift on recommendations
- Multi‑tenant SaaS: Kubernetes + Postgres schemas + SSO/SAML; GitOps deployments and SLO alerts

---

## How I Deliver
1) Understand constraints and desired outcomes
2) Propose architecture options with trade‑offs
3) Ship increments behind feature flags and measure impact
4) Automate observability, recovery, and docs along the way
